# repotools

Short names, big time savings â€“ a collection of commands
for the git operations you perform most often.

Meaningful and memorable: All of the commands have names that,
even though short, make sense... For the most part ;)

The commands are, in short order: `dp`, `aa`, `st`, `di`, `cm`, `pu` and `le`.

Read on below to see what they mean and what arguments they take, or
[skip straight to installation](#installation) if you are feeling too impatient.
(But do go back and read how to use them afterwards if you do go ahead and
install them right away.)

## Usage

## Installation

Precompiled binaries will be provided in the future, but for now you'll need
to have the Rust toolchain installed. If you don't have the Rust toolchain
installed already, head over to https://rustup.rs/ and follow the instructions
there and then come back here.

Once you have the Rust toolchain installed, simply run:

```bash
cargo install repotools
```
