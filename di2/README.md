## Usage

### `di [<path>...]` â€“ diff staged, optionally limited to one or more files or directories

Prior to committing, and also now and then while still working on the code,
it is very useful to review what you are about commit, both to ensure that
you are about to commit what you think you are about to commit, and in order to
write useful commit messages that accurately describe the changes.

`di` shows the diff for the staged changes against HEAD.

`di` calls `git diff --cached` with the optionally provided argument.
