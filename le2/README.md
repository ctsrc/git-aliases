## Usage

### `le` â€“ number of commits

Among all of the aliases, this is the only one that doesn't match
the meaning with its name. I would have named this alias as I initially
did; `nc`, if it wasn't for the fact that the netcat command on a lot
of systems is named `nc` already. And when I used aliases, I didn't feel
like having to remember to type `\nc` when I wanted netcat, nor did I
and nor do I feel like typing out the full path to netcat either, e.g.
`/usr/bin/nc`. So I took the "l" for "log" and the "e" for the `-e` flag.

`le` calls `git shortlog -se`.
