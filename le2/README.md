This crate provides the `le` command, and is part of the
[repotools](https://crates.io/crates/repotools) set of utilities.

You can install all of the repotools utilites by running
the following command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo install repotools
```

If you want to install only some of them, you can install them
individually. Refer to the [repotools](https://crates.io/crates/repotools)
for the full list of utilities and links to their individual crates.

To install `le` utility individually, run the following
command in your terminal:

```bash
cargo install le2
```

## Usage

### `le` â€“ number of commits by each author in git repository

Among all of the commands, this is the only one that doesn't match
the meaning with its name. I would have named this command as I initially
did; `nc`, if it wasn't for the fact that the netcat command on a lot
of systems is named `nc` already.

The name comes from "l" for "log" and "e" for the `-e` flag.

`le` is like `git shortlog -se`, only more awesome.
